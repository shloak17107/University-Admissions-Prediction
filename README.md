# University Admissions Prediction

Hundreds of thousands of undergraduate students in India apply to graduate programs in the United States every year. A single student’s application requires many components such as a GRE score, TOEFL score, Statement of Purpose, Letters of Recommendation, CGPA, Research Ex- perience, Conference Publications, Internship Experiences, Industry Experience, Research Experience, and others. Applying to a single university can cost hundreds of dollars in application fees, sending test scores, and more. This project aims to solve this problem by predicting whether an appli- cant will be admitted to a university or not. The prediction is done by analysing Edulix.com’s data of Indian students who previously applied to graduate programs in the US.

#### The code

Python version: 3.7.4

All the preprocessing and modelling is contained within the files `Code.py` and `Code.ipynb`. It's recommended to open the Jupyter Notebook as the code is divided into sections and further split into cells with outputs.

The classifiers we used are:
* SVM
* Random Forest
* Logistic Regression
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Naïve Bayes
* Multilayer Perceptron
* Neural Networks (Tensorflow)
